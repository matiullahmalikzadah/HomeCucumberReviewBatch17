framework - thi is the final autcom of the complete concept

cucumber as a tool
cucumber/BDD/gherkin as a framework

group id - it means the name of the organization
artifact id - it means the name of the project

we created maven project
pom.xml file is the configuration file where we will ass all the dependencies
pom.xml is the file we will use to execute our code in the end of the framework
pom.xml is the file we will use to generate the report

in our project we get src folder in which we get main and test
main - the code we write to develop the application, we write it in main
test - the code we write to test the application, we write it in test

we delete main folder because we will work with test

in the test folder -
we get java - to keep all teh java stuff
we get resources - to keep all the non java stuff

java
selenium
cucumber
apache poi
commons io


Class 2-
Note: in selenium we dont have reporting option, no execution cantro, no standard formewrok of writing the code.
to achieve all these we need to intergrate our scripts with
additional tools and structure (framework)

Cucumber is tool which allows us to write scenarios in plian english
text called ghekin which follow BBD (behaviorl driven development)

in gharkin we have to follow these are :-
Given - pre condition
When - actions
Then - expected result
And - supporting tag
like:

Scenario - login
Given user is navigated to HRMS application
When user enters admin username and password
And user click on login button
Then admin user is successfully logged in

User Story  - Employee search
Scenario - search employee by id
   Given user is navigated to HRMS application
   When user enters admin username and password
   And user click on login button
   Then admin user is successfully logged in
   When user click on PIM option
   And user click on employee List option
   When user enters employee id
   And user click on search button
   Then user should be able to see employee details
